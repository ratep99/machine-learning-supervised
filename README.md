# Machine Learning Supervised Learning Project

This repository contains the code and materials for our first machine learning project focused on supervised learning algorithms.
The project explores the fundamentals of supervised learning and includes implementations and evaluations of various algorithms. 
It was developed in collaboration with my teammate [StevanGrujic](https://github.com/StevanGrujic).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models using supervised learning techniques. 
We have explored a range of algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors

Each algorithm has been implemented and evaluated on relevant datasets to gain insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and suitable use cases.
The code, experiments, and results are documented in the project notebooks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Notebooks:** This directory contains Jupyter notebook that showcase the implementation of supervised learning algorithms. 

- **Dataset:** This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models. 

- **Results:** This directory stores the results of our experiments, including evaluation metrics, accuracy scores, visualizations, and any other relevant outputs.
